## Yellevate: A Statistical Investigation on Disputes and Losses

### Overview

Yellevate is an imaginary company that helps with marketing and online support for mid-sized companies. It has been struggling with client disputes that have resulted in a vast amount of revenue losses. We, the data analysts, were tasked to identify the causes of these disputes and develop actionable strategies to solve them.


### Methodology and Findings

We inspected and cleaned the data collected using SQL. The cleaned dataset was then analyzed using Excel to obtain the following information:

### Recommendations

Yellevate must look into a win-win situation with its clients. It is possible that payment 
schemes or lower interest rates be made for companies that are delayed in payments. Proper 
documentation and communication must be strictly implemented as well to mitigate 
disputes.

On the contrary, to make the policy more stringent, the company can also include 
another clause in contracts and policies regarding clients who frequently raise disputes. 
Clients who have a poor track record of settling invoices may also face sanctions.

It is also worth noting that Key-Performance Indexes among countries should be 
revisited as different countries have different cultures that might not be fit for all.
Lastly, as part of continuous improvement in customer service, it is also imperative that 
a survey with respect to the service conducted may be applied and a follow-up email to clients 
giving them a feeling that they are very well taken care of.
