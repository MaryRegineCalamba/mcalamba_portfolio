## Yellevate: A Statistical Investigation on Disputes and Losses

### Overview

Yellevate is an imaginary company that helps with marketing and online support for mid-sized companies. It has been struggling with client disputes that have resulted in a vast amount of revenue losses. We, the data analysts, were tasked to identify the causes of these disputes and develop actionable strategies to solve them.

We inspected and cleaned the data collected using SQL. The cleaned dataset was then analyzed using Excel to obtain the following information:
